## Profile
- Hi everyone - my name is Corinne! I'm a 2nd year MURP in the Design and Development concentration (with a sprinkle of EAP classes).
- I was born in Philly and grew up in Wayne, PA - a nearby suburb.
- I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2017 as a Spanish and International Relations double major.
- For 2 years I lived in Memphis, TN, where I taught high school Spanish as a Teach for Ameria corps member.
- Urban planning became interesting to me as I got to know Memphis, my students and their families - especially topics like environmenal justice, transportation, food security, and parks and open space access.
- Wanting to learn more about planning, I took a job in Austin, TX at a landscape architecture and urban planning/design firm.
- I got to work on some cool stuff - park vision plans, sustainable landscape certifications (SITES), community engagement, etc.
- I came to LA via a 1.5 week road trip from Austin to attend UCLA!
- I don't currently have pets but I set up a saltwater fish tank during peak quarantine.

## Course Description
I have taken two GIS classes in QGIS and Esri since being at UCLA, both in the Geography Department. Mapping and analyzing spatial data are skills that I really want to further develop and I'm excited to learn a totally different approach with R.

## Project Ideas
I'm technically auditing this class, so am supporting the Philadelphia project team. 

## Course Objectives
Further my mapping and spatial analysis abilities and learn how to do some coding!
